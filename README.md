# MessageGenerator

## WHAT IS THIS?
This is a project that I created using JavaScript on VS Code. I then uploaded the code to GitHub from VS Code. 
The project overview required me to build a message generator programme, where every time a user runs it, they should get a new and randomised output.
Some of the suggested project ideas were an astrology generator, an inspirational message generator, and a non-sensical joke generator.
I created a non-sensical advice generator.

The project objectives were as follows:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

## WHY DOES THIS EXIST?
I am currently learning how to use JavaScript via a Codecademy course. I am also learning how to use Git and GitHub, but I am finding this part quite tricky.

## PERSONAL REFLECTION ON THIS PROJECT

### Positives
_____________
I enjoyed making the JS code. It produced a range of incredibly non-sensical outputs, some of which were quite amusing, for example:

"Don't be an ancient hambuger, no-one will explore you."
AND
"I suggest that you think moistly, if you aim to know pirates."

### Things I Could Improve
_____________
I know there are parts of the code that could be vastly improved, for example, my mentor has pointed out that the additional functions for getVerb() and getNoun() etc are quite unneccessary. 
My counter-reasoning for keeping them is just clarity for myself as I was creating the program.

I also know that I have created empty variables then immediately assigned them values underneath - I am still learning about when I should use global vs local variables.
To start with, I tried to declare these as local variables within a function, but the code I was writing became much more complex than I needed it to be. 
I found that I had to move the defining statements further up in the document because the sentences were coming out with blank parts where there should have been randomized words.
I ended up with these variable declarations and definitions adjacent to each-other and have genuinely been too lazy to bother cleaning them up, as this is just a small project and I want to continue learning, specifically about how to incorporate JS code into websites I have already built.

My mentor has also pointed out to me that the code I have written required him to "jump all over the place" in order to follow it. He reccomended that I should declare and define variables and arrays etc at the top of the document, and create functions nearer the bottom of the document. 
I guess this makes sense, because the functions will most likely refer to the information at the top of the document, which I guess needs to exist prior to the function so that it can be accessed by that function.

The .git folder with all of the changes that I tracked locally was not uploaded to GitHub, as I deleted it to unattach it from the repository that my mentor linked it to (he created a folder that was separate to all of my other coding projects, which I just didn't like, so I changed it).
I don't know if this was neccessary, because I am still trying to understand how to use VS code and GitHub in reality rather than theory. 

Lastly, I am well-aware that the arrays that contain the random words often don't make much literal sense when they are inserted into the sentence structures.
I got to a point in this project where I felt the proof-of-concept was what I needed to achieve, rather than really refining it to try and make it flawless. 
To improve upon what I already had, I could have created word bank arrays that would make sense together in a sentence, rather than picking random nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but I also think this would have been less fun.
Another thing I could add to improve this is a conditional that can determine whether a or an should be used, based on whatever random word comes after it. This is something that I have done before using JS, so I decided against spending additional time doing it again in this project.

### An Emotional Rant
__________________
I found this difficult, because I was initially very overwhelmed at how over-complicated the whole Git and GitHub thing is, especially given its purpose is to record project progress as a number of backups.
I have come away from this project feeling like people continue to use command line practices and keep things like GitHub more complicated than they need to be, as a method of "gate-keeping" the coding profession. 
Similar to how politics are overcomplicated and boring to put certain people off becoming involved.
In saying all of that, I also do understand the importance of learning about the methods and processes that precede current practice, as we largely all stand on the shoulders of giants and like to claim superiority. 
I just don't think there is a need to continue using what appear to be outdated practices in coding. I hope something changes my mind later on about this.
